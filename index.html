    <h3>Forex & Cryptocurrency Trading</h3>
    <p><strong>Duration:</strong> 2021 – Present</p>
    <p>
      I am a funded Forex and Crypto trader with over 3 years of hands-on experience. I trade using ICT (Inner Circle Trader), Smart Money Concepts (SMC), and Smart Money Techniques (SMT) strategies. My trading approach combines technical and fundamental analysis, and I have developed my own custom Expert Advisors (EAs) for automated trading. I focus on risk-managed strategies, identifying institutional order flow, and analyzing market structure to make informed decisions in both Forex and crypto markets.

      I worked as a cashier and assistant accountant at NISMA Emporium, handling daily transactions, bookkeeping, and stock records. I also introduced the company to digital tools and software for business operations, such as accounting systems, billing applications, and inventory management tools. This helped modernize and streamline the company's workflow, improving accuracy and efficiency in day-to-day operations.
